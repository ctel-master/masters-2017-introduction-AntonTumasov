					When it comes to <b>education</b>, the model has been pretty
					straight forward - up until the early ‘00s education was
					in a classroom of students with a teacher who led the
					process. Physical presence was a no-brainer, and any
					other type of learning was questionable at best. Then the
					computer evolution happened and it radically changed
					the learning landscape.
					<p class="full">In essence, e-learning is a computer based educational
					tool or system that enables you to learn anywhere and at
					any time. Today e-learning is mostly delivered though
					the internet, although in the past it was delivered using
					a blend of computer-based methods like CD-ROM.
					Technology has advanced so much that the geographical
					gap is bridged with the use of tools that make you feel as 
					if you are inside the classroom. E-learning offers the
					ability to share material in all kinds of formats such as
					videos, slideshows, word documents and PDFs.
					Conducting webinars (live online classes) and
					communicating with professors via chat and message
					forums is also an option available to users.</p>
					<p  class="full">There is a plethora of different e-learning systems
					(otherwise known as Learning Management Systems, or
					LMSs for short) and methods, which allow for courses to
					be delivered. With the right tool various processes can
					be automated such as the marking of tests or the
					creation of engaging content. E-learning provides the
					learners with the ability to fit learning around their
					lifestyles, effectively allowing even the busiest person to
					further a career and gain new qualifications.
					Some of the most important developments in education
					have happened since the launch of the internet. These
					days learners are well versed in the use of smartphones,
					text messaging and using the internet so participating in
					and running an online course has become a simple
					affair. Message boards, social media and various other
					means of online communication allow learners to keep 
					in touch and discuss course related matters, whilst
					providing for a sense of community.</p>

					<p  class="full">In the fast-paced world of e-learning the available
					technologies to make a course exciting are always
					changing, and course content can and should be
					updated quickly to give students the very latest
					information. This is especially important if the elearning
					training is being given to employees in a sector
					where keeping up-to-date on industry developments is
					of the utmost importance. This is one of the reasons why
					many businesses are now offering training via elearning
					- other reasons includes low costs and the
					ability for employees to study in their own time and
					place.</p>
					<p  class="full">Overall, traditional learning is expensive, takes a long
					time and the results can vary. E-learning offers an
					alternative that is faster, cheaper and potentially better</p>

					The term “e-learning” has only been in existence since
					1999, when the word was first utilized at a CBT systems
					seminar. Other words also began to spring up in search
					of an accurate description such as “online learning” and
					“virtual learning”. However, the principles behind elearning
					have been well documented throughout
					history, and there is even evidence which suggests that
					early forms of e-learning existed as far back as the 19th
					century.
					An e-learning timeline
					Long before the internet was launched, distance courses
					were being offered to provide students with education
					on particular subjects or skills. In the 1840′s Isaac
					Pitman taught his pupils shorthand via correspondence. 
					
					<p  class="full">
					This form of symbolic writing was designed to improve
					writing speed and was popular amongst secretaries,
					journalists, and other individuals who did a great deal of
					note taking or writing. Pitman, who was a qualified
					teacher, was sent completed assignments by mail and he
					would then send his students more work to be finished
					using the same system.
					In 1924, the first testing machine was invented. This
					device allowed students to tests themselves. Then, in
					1954, BF Skinner, a Harvard Professor, invented the
					“teaching machine”, which enabled schools to
					administer programmed instruction to their students. It
					wasn’t until 1960 however that the first computer based
					training program was introduced to the world. This
					computer based training program (or CBT program)
					was known as PLATO-Programmed Logic for
					Automated Teaching Operations. It was originally
					designed for students attending the University of
					Illinois, but ended up being used in schools throughout
					the area.</p>
					<p  class="full">
					The first e-learning systems were really only set up to
					deliver information to students but as we entered the
					70s e-learning started to become more interactive. In 
					Britain the Open University was keen to take advantage
					of e-learning. Their system of education has always been
					primarily focused on learning at a distance. In the past,
					course materials were delivered by post and
					correspondence with tutors was via mail. With the
					internet the Open University began to offer a wider
					range of interactive educational experiences as well as
					faster correspondence with students via email etc.
					Online learning today
					With the introduction of the computer and internet in
					the late 20th century, e-learning tools and delivery
					methods expanded. The first MAC in the 1980′s enabled
					individuals to have computers in their homes, making it
					easier for them to learn about particular subjects and
					develop certain skill sets. Then, in the following decade,
					virtual learning environments began to truly thrive, with
					people gaining access to a wealth of online information
					and e-learning opportunities.</p>
					<p  class="full">
					By the early 90s several schools had been set up that
					delivered courses online only, making the most of the
					internet and bringing education to people who wouldn't
					previously have been able to attend a college due to
					geographical or time constraints. Technological 
					advancements also helped educational establishments
					reduce the costs of distance learning, a saving that
					would also be passed on to the students - helping bring
					education to a wider audience.
					In the 2000′s, businesses began using e-learning to
					train their employees. New and experienced workers
					alike now had the opportunity to improve upon their
					industry knowledge base and expand their skill sets. At
					home individuals were granted access to programs that
					offered them the ability to earn online degrees and
					enrich their lives through expanded knowledge.</p>
